Timothy Place engages with this ephemeral world through creative processes that captivate the body, mind, soul, and spirit.
For more than 10 years he has helped shape the development of products by Cycling '74 including Max through design, coding, and process.
In addition to founding the open-source Jamoma project and the private company Electrotap (makers of the legendary Teabox sensor interface, Hipno Plug-ins and TapTools),
Tim has lectured, taught, and performed throughout the world.

When not trapped inside his mind he can be found climbing rock and ice in the mountains, building furniture with hand tools, whitewater-kayaking, enjoying time with his family, and riding thousands of miles on his bicycle every year.

# Through 74 Objects he takes on select consulting opportunities and continues to create interesting things. Timothy is currently designing software for Cycling '74, running Electrotap, creating interactive music and art, leading the open-source Jamoma project, building furniture with hand tools, enjoying time with his family, and riding thousands of miles on his bicycle.
